- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


I think encapsulation is interesting, but I like how it makes things feel cleaner when programming. This assignment came at a time when I was already swamped with work, so I wish I could've spent more time with it. For future assignments, I will try to carve out more time. Experimenting generally worked, as I could always ask the TA, discord, or google (I found some useful information about Java conventions from the website GeeksforGeeks) to solve issues that would arise. I would suggest someone taking this course to start earlier and to not be afraid to seek out help.
